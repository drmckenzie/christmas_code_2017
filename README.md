# christmas_code_2017

This is largely a space for me messing about in Python for a Christmas Code Contest in December 2017.

Rules are in "Rules.txt"

There is a good wordsearch generator here:

And the equivalent of MATLAB's ismember (really quick lookup) is here:

https://stackoverflow.com/a/15864429/1530103

Which would maybe hint that we should be using a dictionary to lookup the words (this seems blindingly obvious now I type it out.)
