# christmas_code_2017

This is largely a space for me messing about in Python for a Christmas Code Contest in December 2017.

Rules are in "Rules.txt"

There is a good wordsearch generator here (The wordsearch 2 & 3 were generated from here):

And the equivalent of MATLAB's ismember (really quick lookup) is here:

https://stackoverflow.com/a/15864429/1530103

Which would maybe hint that we should be using a dictionary to lookup the words (this seems blindingly obvious now I type it out.)

The wordsearch 4 was copied from here:
http://www.whenwewordsearch.com/word_search/have_fun/126/word_search.jsp
There was supposed to be 36 words. I got 15 in that list, along with 180 total. (there were some tricky ones, and compound American words, so that's respectable.)

Using the dictionary in json form from (blimey, this is fast!):
