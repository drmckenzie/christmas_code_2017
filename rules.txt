Chaps,

A number of you will remember that we have run a coding challenge for fun at Christmas in the last few years.  Some people have submitted solutions to this many have ignored it, please feel welcome to have a go, but under no obligation to do so (there's no booking code!)

In previous years we've found that people quite like challenges that are pretty short and allow an entry in any language.

For 2017 the coding challenge is a word search:

The example given is shown such that it is easy to see the words you are looking for.

We are doing an agile Challenge. If people find it easy to find the starting points of the words I will make a second word search of a larger size, a different shape, but with the same words in it. However, the second search will have the dots replaced with other letters, and will be blind test.

Here are the rules that you may or may not follow:

1. Code to be ready in first week of next year.
2. Your code should take in the word search in the format of the text file attached and should write out a text file that has a list with the following columns of data in it:
        -  Word
        -  Row of the first letter
        -  Column of the first letter
3. Any language can be used.
4. Points awarded for code that is easy to read.
5. The second word search will be big so think about how to make your search efficient.
6. Extra points if you spot Christmas words in the second word search not in the example problem (i.e. ones I haven't thought of yet)!
